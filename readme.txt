Title: PokeStats
Author: Julia Yu
Class: CSC212 Fall 2020 Smith College
Info:
PokeStats uses csv files that contain information about Pokemon up until Generation 6.
Can filter by a given type, stat, etc. Contains a guessing game about Pokemon and their types.
This project mostly serves as a way to learn about Pokemon, their typing, and their stats

Disclaimer:
Since this program utilizes csv files only containing information about Pokemon and moves from Generation 6 (2013 to 2014),
some of the info in the program will differ from up-to-date information (the games are at Generation 8, released in 2019)
